## Project: zenshin.

The core aim of this project is to explore various technologies like HLS Video Streaming, WebTorrent, ElectronJS and WebScraping to extract what is already provided to a user on the internet. 
All content available through the project is hosted by external non-affiliated sources and is not under our control.

Any content served through this project is publicly accessible. If your site is listed in this project, the code is pretty much public. Take necessary measures to counter the exploits used to extract content from your site.

This project can be considered as a combination of a browser and a webscraper. While an average browser makes hundreds of requests to get everything from a site, this project goes on to make requests associated with only getting the content served by the sites.

This project has no control on the content it is serving, using copyrighted content from the providers is not going to be accounted for by the developer. It is the user's own risk.


<h2 align="center">DMCA and Copyright Infrigements</h3>

A browser is a tool, and the maliciousness of the tool is directly based on the user.
This project uses client-side content access mechanisms. Hence, the copyright infrigements or DMCA in this project's regards are to be forwarded to the associated site by the associated notifier of any such claims. As of writing this is [animepahe](https://animepahe.ru/) and [animetosho](https://animetosho.org/).
